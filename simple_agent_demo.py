Simple FinRobot + IntentCore Demo (No LLM API Required)

This simulates an agent decision without needing OpenAI API keys.
Perfect for testing the IntentCore UI integration.

Usage:
1. Terminal 1: cd intentcore/ui/backend && python3 -m uvicorn api:app --reload
2. Terminal 2: cd intentcore/ui/frontend && npm run dev
3. Terminal 3: python3 simple_agent_demo.py
4. Browser: Open http://localhost:3000 to review the decision

Analyzing portfolio concentration...

Current Situation:
Our technology sector allocation is at 38% of total portfolio ($333M out of $875M total AUM),
which exceeds our 35% sector maximum policy. The top holding is NVDA at $280M (32% of portfolio),
well above our 25% individual position limit.

Quantitative Analysis:
- Portfolio total: $875M
- Tech sector: $333M (38% - exceeds 35% limit)
- NVDA position: $280M (32% - exceeds 25% limit)
- Required NVDA reduction: Minimum $61M to reach 25% limit
- Recommended reduction: $75M to provide buffer

Market Context:
- NVDA trading at $487.50
- Q4 earnings tomorrow (high event risk)
- Recent volatility: 18.2% (elevated)
- Sector rotation signals emerging

Options Considered:
1. Reduce NVDA by minimum ($61M) - Meets policy but no buffer
2. Reduce NVDA by $75M - Provides buffer, reduces earnings risk
3. Wait until post-earnings - Risk of further concentration if stock rises
4. Diversify within tech - Doesn't address NVDA concentration

Risks:
- Execution risk: Large position reduction may impact price
- Timing risk: Pre-earnings trade increases uncertainty
- Opportunity risk: May miss upside if earnings beat expectations
- Compliance risk: Current position violates portfolio policy

Rationale:
Given the clear policy violation (32% vs 25% max), elevated pre-earnings risk, and
fiduciary duty to maintain diversification, I recommend reducing NVDA position by $75M.
This brings us to 23.4% of portfolio, provides compliance buffer, and reduces event risk.

Executing trade: Sell $75M NVDA
